# webGIS
Web application for measuring the shortest and the fastest paths between amenities in Bjelovar, Croatia.
Only works with appropriate PostgreSQL database. :)

This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run. 

Clone the project. Inside the working directory, install the dependencies and start the server to run the project.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You can see the map on localhost:3000/map route. 

Enjoy. :)
